# 🔧 Secondary Market Contract Address Issue - RESOLVED

## ❌ Problem Identified

The secondary market smart contract was throwing an error when deployed to cPanel:

```
Error: Invalid contract address: 0x02D855F16695f16695f7937da07aA8E4bAB7298548650E
```

**Root Cause**: The contract address was corrupted during the build process, showing a duplicated address:
- **Expected**: `0x02D855F16695f7937da07aA8E4bAB7298548650E`
- **Actual (corrupted)**: `0x02D855F16695f16695f7937da07aA8E4bAB7298548650E`

## 🔍 Investigation Results

1. **Environment Files**: Multiple .env files were found:
   - `.env` - Had correct address ✅
   - `.env.production` - Had corrupted address ❌
   - `.env.backup` - Backup file

2. **Build Configuration**: Vite config had `'process.env': {}` which was overriding environment variables

3. **Build Process**: The corrupted address was being embedded in the built JavaScript files

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Vite Configuration
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
define: {
  global: 'globalThis',
  'process.env': {}, // This was overriding env vars
},

// After (fixed)
define: {
  global: 'globalThis',
  // Removed the problematic override
},
```

### 2. Corrected Environment Files
- Updated `.env.production` with correct address from `.env`
- Ensured all environment files have consistent, correct addresses

### 3. Rebuilt Project
- Clean build with corrected configuration
- Verified correct address is now embedded in build files

## 📋 Current Status

- ✅ **Issue Resolved**: Contract address corruption fixed
- ✅ **Build Corrected**: New build contains proper address
- ✅ **Deployment Ready**: cPanel package created with fixes
- ✅ **Verification Complete**: Both correct and corrupted addresses verified
