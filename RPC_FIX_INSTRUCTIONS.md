# RPC Connectivity Fix Instructions

## Problem Identified
Your BSC Mainnet RPC endpoint `https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org/` is currently experiencing connectivity issues, causing the "could not decode result data" errors in your dApp.

## Solution Implemented
I've added RPC failover functionality to your codebase with multiple backup endpoints.

## Manual Fix Required
Since your `.env` file is protected, you need to manually update it:

### Option 1: Update your .env file
```bash
# Change this line in your .env file:
VITE_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org/

# To this working alternative:
VITE_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed2.binance.org/
```

### Option 2: Use the new failover system
Your code now has `getContractsWithFailover()` function that automatically tries multiple RPC endpoints:
- https://bsc-dataseed2.binance.org
- https://bsc-dataseed3.binance.org  
- https://bsc-mainnet.nodereal.io/v1/64a9df0874fb4a93b9d0a3849de012d3
- https://bsc-dataseed1.defibit.io
- https://bsc-dataseed1.ninicoin.io

## Testing Results
✅ **Working RPCs tested:**
- https://bsc-dataseed2.binance.org (WORKING)
- https://bsc-dataseed3.binance.org (WORKING)  
- https://bsc-mainnet.nodereal.io/v1/64a9df0874fb4a93b9d0a3849de012d3 (WORKING)

❌ **Failed RPCs:**
- https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org (FAILING - your current one)
- https://rpc.ankr.com/bsc (FAILING)

## Next Steps
1. Update your .env file with the new RPC URL
2. Restart your development server
3. Test the dApp in browser - the errors should be resolved

## Prevention
The new failover system will automatically switch to working RPC endpoints in the future, preventing similar issues.
