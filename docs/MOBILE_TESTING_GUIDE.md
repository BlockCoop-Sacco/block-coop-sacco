### 5. Responsive Breakpoints

The fixes use these Tailwind CSS breakpoints:

- **Mobile**: `< 640px` (default styles)
- **Small**: `sm: ≥ 640px` 
- **Large**: `lg: ≥ 1024px`

#### Key Responsive Classes Applied:

**Modal Container:**
```css
max-w-sm sm:max-w-md lg:max-w-2xl  /* Responsive width */
p-3 sm:p-4                         /* Responsive padding */
```

**Button Layout:**
```css
flex-col sm:flex-row               /* Stack on mobile, row on desktop */
w-full sm:flex-1                   /* Full width on mobile, flex on desktop */
gap-3                              /* Consistent spacing */
```

**Text Sizing:**
```css
text-lg sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl     /* Responsive text sizes */
text-xs sm:text-sm                 /* Smaller text responsive */
```

### 6. Automated Testing

Run the mobile responsiveness tests:

```bash
npm run test src/tests/mobile-responsiveness.test.tsx
```

This verifies that all responsive CSS classes are properly applied.

### 7. Real Device Testing
